** Should we use [Active Admin] [1] in our projects or not? **

I share the next presentation in which belong to a talk that I presented

answer the question or at least re-think the pros and cons

Active Admin is a Ruby on Rails plugin for generating
administration style interfaces, you can see the [online version][3].
