This is the first post of my blog. So now I should just start to write...

### Write about What?

Mmmm... I'm a web developer and my favourite language at the moment is Ruby,
so here probably you will find some post about Ruby & friends...

### Ok, but how are the Ruby's friends?

At least to me the Ruby's friends would be all relationship with POO,
Agile and Pragmatic software development, something for another languages
like javascript, etc. The list would be very long but in short it will be
about development in general.

### Anything else?

Yes, you'll find some audio about IT that every week prepare for the online
radio [Frecuencia Primavera][1]. Enjoy!
