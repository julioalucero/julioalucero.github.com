This is my new blog where the idea is write one post per month.

### About What?

I'm a web developer and my favourite language is Ruby, so here you can find
some post about Ruby & friends.

### How are the Ruby's friends?

To me the Ruby's friends can be all relationship with POO, Agile Development, some
another languages like javascript, all about web development and so on.
